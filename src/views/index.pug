        | Pixelflux allows you to claim ownership over pixel layers.
        | If you own the topmost layer of a pixel, you can customize its color.
        | While your ownership of a layer is permanent, others can purchase a new layer on top of yours. 
      p
        | When this happens, the payment for the new layer is distributed among all existing layer owners of that pixel.
      p 
        | Each time a layer is added, the pixel's value increases by its base price. 
        | It's possible to buy several layers at once.
